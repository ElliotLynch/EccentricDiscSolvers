# EccentricDiscSolvers
Python Code For Studying Eccentric Waves in 3D fluid Discs

Theory Covered in Papers:

 * Hamiltonian hydrodynamics of eccentric discs; Ogilvie G. I, Lynch E. M. 2019; 10.1093/mnras/sty3436
 
   * Introduces Hamiltonian formalism for fluid discs.

* Future Publication in Prep

  * Covers numerical solution of eccentric modes in the Hamiltonian formalism
  
* Future Publication in Prep

  * Covers nonideal effects such as viscous heating and radiative cooling on the breathing mode


# TODO

 * Figure out how to gitignore cython generated c files

 * src needs to be a single cython package to allow for relative imports

 * Include some functionality to work without cython?

 * Finally get round to converting to python 3
 
 * Write save routines for RADMC,REBOUND,PHANTOM?, and Timothee's GPU sph code when it's a little further in development
